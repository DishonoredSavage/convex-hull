# Convex Hull

Visualises the gift wrapping algorithm for finding the convex hull of a set of pseudo-randomly generated points.  The pseudocode and more information on the algorithm is provided at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm.
- Worst-case running time - O(nh) where h is the number of points on the convex hull
